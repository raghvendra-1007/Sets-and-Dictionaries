Question-1

Given a list of email addresses with duplicates, write a Python script to remove duplicates and store the unique emails in a new list.

email_list = [ "alice@example.com", "bob@example.com", "alice@example.com", "charlie@example.com", "bob@example.com", "david@example.com" ]

Question-2

Given a list of employees and their monthly salaries in tuples, create a dictionary to store the total salary paid to each employee over multiple months.

salary_data = [ ("Alice", 50000), ("Bob", 60000), ("Alice", 52000), ("Charlie", 70000), ("Bob", 62000), ("Charlie", 71000) ]

Question-3

You have a dictionary mapping product names to unique numerical IDs.
Given a list of product orders (each containing a product name), update the list to include the corresponding product ID.
product_mapping = { "Laptop": 101, "Smartphone": 102, "Tablet": 103, "Headphones": 104 }

orders = [ {"customer": "Alice", "product": "Laptop"}, {"customer": "Bob", "product": "Smartphone"}, {"customer": "Charlie", "product": "Tablet"} ]

Question-4

Define a dictionary representing the schema of a student database, with fields like Student_ID, Name, Age, and GPA.
Given a sample student record, validate whether the data types match the expected schema.

student_schema = { "Student_ID": "Integer", "Name": "String", "Age": "Integer", "GPA": "Float" }

student_record = { "Student_ID": 201, "Name": "John Doe", "Age": 21, "GPA": 3.8 }

Question-5

Given a dictionary containing department names as keys and their revenue as values, use Matplotlib to generate a bar chart showing the revenue distribution.

department_revenue = { "Electronics": 500000, "Clothing": 300000, "Grocery": 400000, "Furniture": 350000, "Toys": 200000 }

Question-6

Given a list of product sales (each as a tuple containing product name and quantity sold), use a dictionary to track the total quantity sold for each product.

sales_data = [ ("Laptop", 5), ("Smartphone", 8), ("Tablet", 3), ("Laptop", 2), ("Smartphone", 4), ("Headphones", 10) ]

Question-7

Given a dictionary mapping department names to numerical codes, update a list of employee records by adding the corresponding department code to each record.

department_mapping = { "HR": 1, "Engineering": 2, "Marketing": 3, "Sales": 4 }

employees = [ {"name": "Alice", "department": "HR"}, {"name": "Bob", "department": "Engineering"}, {"name": "Charlie", "department": "Marketing"} ]

Question-8

Given a list of tuples where each tuple contains a movie name and a user rating, create a dictionary that stores the average rating of each movie.

movie_ratings = [ ("Inception", 4.5), ("Interstellar", 4.8), ("Inception", 4.7), ("Tenet", 4.2), ("Interstellar", 4.9), ("Tenet", 4.3) ]

Question-9

Define a dictionary containing the eligibility criteria for a loan application (e.g., Minimum Salary, Credit Score).
Given a sample loan applicant's data, check whether they meet the eligibility criteria.

loan_criteria = { "Minimum Salary": 30000, "Credit Score": 700 }

applicant_data = { "Name": "David", "Salary": 35000, "Credit Score": 720 }

Question-10

Given a dictionary where expense categories are keys and their corresponding amounts are values, generate a pie chart to visualize the expense distribution using Matplotlib.

expenses = { "Rent": 20000, "Groceries": 8000, "Transport": 5000, "Entertainment": 3000, "Utilities": 4000 }
